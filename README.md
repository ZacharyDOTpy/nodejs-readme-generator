# NodeJS README Generator

## Description
In this challenger I used Inquirer to prompt the user to fill out a README template. Once the user has answered all the prompts, a new README will be generated for them. When the user selects a license from a list the license will be rendered as a badge on their new README.

## Usage
The user can fill out pre-determined fields via NodeJS and Inquirer to create a README.

## Technologies
- NodeJS
- Inquirer
